# Login_Form_v1
-React Login Form with Basic Validation
-This is a simple React application that implements a login form with basic validation. It allows users to enter their first name and last name, and displays a greeting message upon submission. The form includes the following features:
-State Management: Uses React's useState to manage form data (first name, last name) and form submission status.
-Input Validation: The submit button is disabled unless both the first and last name fields are filled.
-Reset Functionality: Resets the form to its initial state when the reset button is clicked.
-Preventing Multiple Submissions: Prevents multiple form submissions by keeping track of whether the form has already been submitted.
-Future enhancements will include more validations, improved error handling, and other user experience improvements.
