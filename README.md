# React Login Form with Basic Validation v.1

This is a simple React application that implements a login form with basic validation. The form allows users to enter their first name and last name, and displays a greeting message upon submission. Below are the key features of the app:

## Features

- **State Management**:  
  Uses React's `useState` to manage form data (first name, last name) and the form submission status.

- **Input Validation**:  
  The submit button is disabled unless both the first and last name fields are filled.

- **Reset Functionality**:  
  Resets the form to its initial state when the reset button is clicked.

- **Preventing Multiple Submissions**:  
  Prevents multiple form submissions by tracking whether the form has already been submitted.

## Future Enhancements

- More advanced validations.
- Improved error handling.
- Other user experience improvements.
